# Create a Password Generator

## Project Description
The purpose of this project was to create a password generator to create a new, secure password. It involved creating a series of window methods including prompt(), confirm(), and alert(); validating each method, and using the variables captured to generate the random password. Starter code with HTML, CSS, and JS files was provided. I made minor changes to the HTML file to update the links for the CSS and JS files. I did not revise the CSS file for this project although in the future I plan to add Media Queries to make the password generator more responsive on mobile devices. 

### Following is the acceptance criteria for the project assignment
